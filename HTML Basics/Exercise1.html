    <h1>My Personal Introduction</h1>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hello! My name is <b>Daniel Elbaz</b> and I'm a
      <i>passionate learner</i>diving into the world of Web Development. I've
      always been fascinated by technology and how it can be used to solve
      real-world problems and create amazing user experiences.

    <h2>My Interests</h2>
    <p>
      I have a wide range of interests that keep me motivated and curious.
      <b>I</b> love <b>coding</b> because it combines creativity with logical
      thinking. When I'm not programming, you can find me reading science
      fiction novels, hiking in nature, or experimenting with new recipes in the
      kitchen. I'm also passionate about <i>sustainable technology</i> and how
      we can use programming to create a better future.
    </p>

    <h2>My Goals</h2>
    <p>
      My main goal is to become a <b>full-stack developer</b> who can build
      complete web applications from start to finish. I want to specialize in
      creating <i>user-friendly interfaces</i> that make technology accessible
      to everyone. In the long term, I hope to contribute to open-source
      projects and maybe even start my own tech company focused on educational
      tools.
    </p>
    <h3>Short-term Goals</h3>
    <p>
      Over the next few months, I plan to master
      <b>HTML, CSS, and Javascript,</b> build several portfolio projects, and
      start contributing to the developer community through blog posts and code
      sharing.
